# Sales-Performance-Dashboard
Sales performance dashboard built from my real Outside Sales results at 84 Lumber, using Excel for cleaning and Tableau for visualization.
# Sales performance dashboard

## Overview

This project uses real sales data from my role as an outside sales representative at 84 Lumber, a building materials company.  
Because the company point of sale system is a legacy DOS based system with no export capability, I manually entered, cleaned, and structured the data in Excel before building an interactive Tableau dashboard to track performance over multiple years.

All customer names are anonymized and sensitive fields are removed.

## Tools used

* Excel for manual data entry, cleaning, and preparation  
* Tableau Public for modeling and dashboard design  

## Main questions answered

* How are sales and gross profit trending by month and by year  
* Which customers are growing the fastest  
* Which customers are at risk based on declining sales or margin  
* How year over year metrics compare for key accounts  

## Key dashboard elements

* KPI cards for sales year to date, year over year growth, and gross profit percentage  
* Monthly trend view that compares years on the same chart  
* Top five growing customers and top five at risk customers  
* Metric selector to toggle between different measures  

## Files in this repository
